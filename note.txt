notes: 
    be THROUGH --> learn your TCA materials (narloy-z) and how parts interface with each other
    make copies of all files and clean them up with comments and shit

values going out of range for coolprops
heat flux looking Wrong (but nice channel geometries) 
export geometries as nice csv with heat flux
how to smooth out channel geometries into a realistic channel
peak at around 120k W/m^2


change everything to SI (contour is in inches) 

fin efficiency to correct for fins existing (so we can continue analyzing in 1d)
in root solving, bound temperature of hot wall and cool wall for the geometry configuration
basically manually iterating through optimal geometry
keep the geometries constant
f1 and f2 should be 0
you don't need to solve for cw at the same time bc cw is dep on hw
wtf to put on the presentation --> esp if i'm not able to get perf results 


NOMINAL VALUES (except for N)
channel_range = np.linspace(100, 100, 1) # N
height_range = np.linspace(0.00635, 0.00635, 1) # h 0.00635 in m
width_range = np.linspace(0.00158, 0.00158, 1) # w 0.00158 in m



THINGS TO DO: 

- note how pressure drops are weird at the moment --> otherwise you'd put a pressure drop graph
- heat flux graph and channel geometry graph
- determine nominal width and number of channels reasoning --> maybe highest heat flux? 
- put everything on github lmao --> can refer to it during presentation
- export geometry and heat flux values to excel

# cols are Z (0), R (1), Area (2), Circum (3)
        # rows are injector face (0), comb end (1), throat (2), nozzle end (3)
        keypts = np.array([data[0], data[399], data[1596], data[2094]])
        new = np.zeros((4,2))
        keypts = np.concatenate((keypts, new), axis = 1)
        keypts[:,2] = np.pi * (keypts[:,1]**2)
        keypts[:,3] = np.pi * 2 * keypts[:,1]
        self.keypts = keypts
ABOVE CODE --- placed in nasaCEA.py getEngineProps as a helper function for key points in contour except i never used it
